# HTTP Protocol, JSON and API's :melon:

- Recap of how the internet works
- We will look at GET requests and POST requests.
- Once we understand the difference we will look at what is an API.
- We will call API, using GET and POST request and get JSON.
- We will also look at what is JSON

## HTTP GET and POST
- Making a request to the server
- Sending information through the server
- GET sends information through the URL, and replys USING HTML, CSS etc
- POST sends information via,JSON or XML file(hidden info)

## JSON

javascript object notation 

## What is an API
Application Programming Interface
An interface for programs to talk to other programs.

Where an old rotary telephone thing where you select the number is good for humans it is not appropriate for machines.

API is the right interface for servers to talk to servers.

Basically it exposes a service in a standardised way using JSON!

JSON! is basically a dictionary in javascript (Not Java) 

e.g.:
- get access to a database (postcode.io)
- Get access to a service  (twillio)
- And many others

## Calling API with GET

## Calling API with POST + JSON

## Interpreting JSON into a dictionary
